An unbiased(?) large sample of procedure information
	Doesn't need to be small group
	If biased, look into Stratified Sampling
Test that the proportions from the sample are statistically significant
	P-Test? - not sure what other tests we might use
Use an online APV formula
	We have the benefits and we use our estimated claims proportions
Check against existing APVs in admin
	SERFF Benefit uploader will give us more APVs to check against
	Analyze the results
	(maybe SERFF uploader will give us enough data to just use ML to predict the weigths)
